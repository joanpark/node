# Opus

Opus is a minimal note-taking application.

It aims to be a mix between a text-editor and code-editor. It reads and writes `.note` files from your native file system. This means it works well with tools like Dropbox for syncing files across your devices.

Much like a code-editor, Opus opens folders and allows you to edit the files inside. You can have multiple windows open, each with a different folder.

## Features

- **üñã Editing**: Supports rich text editing with all the features you'd expect.
- **üìÑ Uses Files**: Uses tangible files in JSON format, not inaccessible databases.
- **üåô Dark Mode**: Includes a dark mode for late night writing.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Customizable**: The sidebar and footer can be hidden for a more focused experience.
- **üìÇ Multiple Projects**: Opus supports opening multiple folders at once.
- **‚ú® Simple**: Opus has only the features you need.

## Installation

You can download the latest macOS binary from [releases](https://github.com/pacocoursey/Opus/releases/latest).

Alternatively, you can run Opus locally from the command line:

```bash
